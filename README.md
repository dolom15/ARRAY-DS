# ARRAY-DS
A list of integers is entered into this program, which then returns the list in reverse order.  The reverseArray function creates a copy of the input list, flips the elements' order using the built-in Reverse() method, and then returns the copy.  The program retrieves the list from the user, invokes the function, and outputs the inverted list in the Main method.
